# Welcome to the project!

## Created an interactive table that displays data from a GraphQL endpoint and implemented following features:

- **Sorting by column** - Allow the user to sort the table data by a specific column in ascending or descending order.
- **Pagination** - Allow the user to navigate through the table using pagination.
- **DataGrid** - full functionality of a DataGrid component, including sorting, filtering, and pagination.

### Additional Information

- The data is coming from the public [GraphQL Star Wars API](https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql)
