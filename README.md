# Welcome to the project!

## Created an interactive table that displays data from a GraphQL endpoint and implemented two of the following features:

- **Sorting by column** - Allow the user to sort the table data by a specific column in ascending or descending order.
- **Pagination** - Allow the user to navigate through the table using pagination.

While we we only ask that you attempt to implement two, additionally, we would like you to consider how you would approach implementing any features you did not include, as we may discuss this during the interview.

You are welcome to come up with and implement your own additional features if you would like to.

**We expect you to spend about 2 - 3 hours on this challenge.**

### Additional Information

- The data is coming from the public [GraphQL Star Wars API](https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql)
